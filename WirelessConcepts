SSID
-----
It is a name used to identify the wireless local area network (WLAN)
The SSID is configured on the AP
The AP usually broadcasts the associated SSID
SSID is transmitted with each packet
Length : Max 32 chars
Case-sensitive
Special characters are allowed.
SSID value identifies the device, person or organisation.

Authentication Process
---------------------
AP broadcasts beacon frames in order to introduce itself. Beacon frames' destination address is broadcast. (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) 
Source address is the address of the AP itself.

1) Client -> AP, Probe Request (Where is that SSID?)
2) AP -> Client, Probe Response (Well, I'm here.) (Destination address is not a broadcast anymore.)
3) Client -> AP, Authentication Request 
4) AP -> Client, Authentication Response
5) Client -> AP, Association Request
6) AP -> Client, Association Response

A wireless network has three basic components : Access Point (AP), Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC) and Ethernet Cable

Access Points(AP)
-----------------
An AP is a transceiver that connects to an Ethernet cable. It bridges the wireless network with the wired network. However, not all wireless networks connect to a 
wired network. Most companies have Wireless LANs (WLANs) that connect to their wired network topology. The AP is where channels are configured. An AP enables 
users to connect to a LAN using wireless technology.

Wireless Router
---------------
A wireless router includes an access point, a router and a switch

Wireless NICs (Network Interface Cards)
---------------------------------------
To be able to use wireless technology, each node or computer must have a wireless NIC
NIC's main objective is to convert radio waves it receives into digital signals that the computer can understand
Cracking WEP requires NICs that can use monitor mode or perform packet injection

The 802.11 Standard
-------------------
It is the first wireless technology standard
It is applied to both Layer1 and Layer2 in OSI layer
Problem : Wireless networks can't detect collisions. CSMA/CS (collision avoidance) is used instead of CSMA/CD

802.11a
-------
802.11a, created in 1999, operates frequency 5GHz 
Throughput 54 Mbps

802.11b 
-------
Operates in the 2.4 GHz
Throughput 11 Mbps
Also referred to as WiFi
Allows for 11 channels to prevent overlapping signals. However, only three channels (1, 6 and 11) can be used in combination without overlapping
Introduced in WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

802.11e
802.11g
802.11i
802.11n
802.11ac

Authentication
--------------
The 802.1X Standard
-------------------
This standard defines the process of authenticating and authorizing users on a WLAN
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), Extensible Authentication protocol (EAP), Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WiFi Protected Access (WPA)

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
-----------------------------
Many ISPs use PPP to connect dial-up or DSL users
PPP handles authentication with a username and password pair, sent with PAP or CHAP
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) sends passwords unencrypted, which is vulnerable to sniffing attacks

CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Server sends a challenge (a random value)
Client sends a response, hashing the random value with the secret password
This is vulnerable to sesion hijacking (some kind of pass the hash)

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
----------------------------------------
EAP is an enhancement to PPP
Allows a company to select its authentication method like Certificates, Kerberos
Kerberos is used on LANs for authentication. It uses tickets and keys. Not common on WLANs

802.1X Components
-----------------
Supplicant : The user accessing a WLAN
Authenticator : The AP
Authentication Server : Checks an account database to see if user's credentials are acceptable. May use RADIUS
