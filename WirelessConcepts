The SSID is configured on the AP
The AP usually broadcasts the associated SSID
SSID is transmitted with each packet

Authentication Process
---------------------
AP broadcasts beacon frames in order to introduce itself. Beacon frames' destination address is broadcast. (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) 
Source address is the address of the AP itself.

1) Client -> AP, Probe Request (Where is that SSID?)
2) AP -> Client, Probe Response (Well, I'm here.) (Destination address is not a broadcast anymore.)
3) Client -> AP, Authentication Request 
4) AP -> Client, Authentication Response
5) Client -> AP, Association Request
6) AP -> Client, Association Response

A wireless network has three basic components : Access Point (AP), Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC) and Ethernet Cable

Access Points(AP)
-----------------
An AP is a transceiver that connects to an Ethernet cable. It bridges the wireless network with the wired network. However, not all wireless networks connect to a 
wired network. Most companies have Wireless LANs (WLANs) that connect to their wired network topology. The AP is where channels are configured. An AP enables 
users to connect to a LAN using wireless technology.

Wireless Router
---------------
A wireless router includes an access point, a router and a switch
